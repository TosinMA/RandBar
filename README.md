**RandBar - Random Dynamics of a Bar System** is an easy to run code to simulate the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of a bar system with attached discrete elements. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. 

The present repository stores the codes associated to the stochastic simulations of a bar system with with attached discrete elements reported in the following paper:
